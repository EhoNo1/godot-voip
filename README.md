godot-voip is a [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) addon which makes it very easy to setup a real-time voice-chat system in your Godot game. This addon also includes a demo project.

## Engine Compatibility
* **_Godot Engine 3.2_:** godot-voip 2.0
* **_Godot Engine 3.3+_:** godot-voip 3.0+

## Setup

### Adding to a existing project

(Any kind of high-level multiplayer peer is required.)
1. Click on the AssetLib inside editor or go to the [Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/425) to download the latest release, or you can clone/download this repository to get the latest commit.
2. Select the `addons/godot-voip/` folder and move it into your Godot project. 
(**Note**: make sure the structure is still `res://addons/godot-voip/`)
3. Go to project-settings/audio and enable audio input.
4. Now go to the plugins tab also inside project-settings and enable the godot-voip plugin.
5. Add either a `VoiceInstance` (one connection) or a `VoiceOrchestrator` (more than 2 participants) node to your scene.
6. Set `$VoiceInstance.recording` or `$VoiceOrchestrator.recording` to `true` and it will send your microphone input to connected participants.

### Running demo
1. Go to the templates tab in the Godot Engine project manager and look for godot-voip, or go to the [Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/951) to manually download the latest release, or you can clone/download this repository to get the latest commit.
2. Open and run downloaded project.

### For macOS users
Users running godot-voip on macOS need to make sure the microphone format in macOS audio settings is equal to the mix-rate in Godot project-settings.

# GDNative
Some parts of this library have been ported to [gdnative-rust](https://godot-rust.github.io/) to improve performance and to implement compression using the [opus-codec](https://opus-codec.org/) and other audio processing. To use the gdnative implementation use the `NativeVoiceInstance` node instead of the usual `VoiceIntance`.

## Building
To compile the gdnative parts of this library you will need **Rust** installed on your machine: https://www.rust-lang.org/. Then open `addons/gdnative/` in your terminal and run `cargo build`. You'll find the compiled binary in `target/`. Then add the compiled binary to your platform in the godot-voip gdnative library called `godot-voip-native.tres` also found in the gdnative directory.

## VoiceInstance <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/casbrugman/godot-voip/master/addons/godot-voip/icons/VoiceInstance.svg" alt="icon" width="32"/>
This node implements a single voice connection.

### Signals
* `received_voice_data(data: PoolRealArray, from_id: int)` Emitted when voice data is received.
* `sent_voice_data(data: PoolRealArray)` Emitted when recording and data is sent.

### Properties

| `float`    | input_threshold                  | Value above which microhphone data will be sent. Set to `0` to disable.                                                                   |

## NativeVoiceInstance <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/casbrugman/godot-voip/master/addons/godot-voip/icons/NativeVoiceInstance.svg" alt="icon" width="32"/>
This node implements a single voice connection using rust-gdnative.

### Signals
* `received_voice_data(data: PoolRealArray, sender_id: int)` Emitted when voice data is received.
* `sent_voice_data(data: PoolRealArray)` Emitted when recording and data is sent.

This node implements multiple voice connections. It will automatically spawn new VoiceInstances when a player connects to the server and will remove them again after they disconnect.

### Signals
* `received_voice_data(data: PoolRealArray, from_id: int)` Emitted when voice data is received.
* `sent_voice_data(data: PoolRealArray)` Emitted when recording and data is sent.
* `created_instance(id: int)` Emitted when a new `VoiceInstance` is created.
* `removed_instance(id: int)` Emitted when a `VoiceInstance` is removed.
